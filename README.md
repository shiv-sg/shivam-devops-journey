# 🚀 Shivam's DevOps Journey

Welcome! I'm **Shivam Gupta**, a DevOps and SRE professional committed to building a **solid foundational knowledge** in cloud infrastructure, automation, and reliability engineering. This repository is my personal learning space where I document, practice, and grow — in public.

🌱 This journey is all about **upskilling**, **exploring industry tools**, and **solidifying core DevOps and SRE concepts** from the ground up.

> ⚠️ **Note:**  
> I am currently working full-time as a DevOps Engineer. This repository contains **only personal learning projects** and does not reflect any internal work, tools, or intellectual property from my employer.
